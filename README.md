## Why ?
If you want to build a monolith project with Next.js which combines server and client in one project. This boilerplate suitable for you! This boilerplate is cost-effective because server and client only have one `node_modules`.

## Setup
- Clone repository
`$ git clone https://github.com/sutanlab/fullstack-next-graphql.git`

- Install depedencies
```bash
# with npm
$ npm install

# or with yarn
$ yarn install
```
- Run server in development mode
```bash
$ npm run dev
# or
$ yarn dev
```

- Before run server in production mode, you must build next files
```bash
$ npm run build
# or
$ yarn build
```

- Start server in production mode
```bash
$ npm start
# or
$ yarn start 
```
